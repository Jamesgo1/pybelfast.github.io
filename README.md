The website for the Belfast Python User Group

## Links

[pybelfast.github.io](https://pybelfast.github.io/)

## Development Info

### Install

```
bundle
bundle exec jekyll serve

Yes it is ironic that a python user group is using [jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) for their website. If
you don't like it, change it :)
